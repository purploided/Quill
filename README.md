# Quill Typing Test Documentation

## Overview
The `Quill` module is a self-invoking function that implements a typing test application. It tracks user input, calculates words per minute (WPM), and provides feedback based on the user's typing speed. It also includes cooldown functionality to reset the test after a specified time.

## Key Components

- **`typingStarted`**: A flag to indicate whether the typing session has started.
- **`userInputElement`**: References the input field where the user types.
- **`typingText`**: Displays the text that the user needs to type.
- **`wpmElement`**: Displays the calculated words per minute.
- **`updateInterval`**: Holds the interval ID for updating WPM.
- **`cooldownEnabled`** and **`cooldownTime`**: Control the cooldown feature to reset the test after a certain time.
- **`SpeedReference`**: An array of predefined text strings that serve as typing samples.
